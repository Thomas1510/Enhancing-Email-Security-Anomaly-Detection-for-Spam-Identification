# Enhancing Email Security: Anomaly Detection for Spam Identification

This repository contains the code and resources for my Email Spam Detector project, developed as part of my BTech in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Cyber Security. The project was completed during my internship at Extion Infotech.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a system that can detect spam emails using advanced machine learning techniques. The project involves:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw email data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Converting textual data into numerical features using Count Vectorizer.
- **Model Training:** Training a Naive Bayes classifier on labeled email data.
- **Prediction and Evaluation:** Classifying new emails as spam or ham and evaluating the model's performance.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

## Key Highlights

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Detailed steps for cleaning and transforming the email data.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Implementing Count Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical format.
3. **Model Training:** Using Naive Bayes classifier to train on the processed data.
4. **Prediction:** Classifying emails and evaluating the accuracy of the model.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-detector.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd email-spam-detector
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5. Open and execute the notebook `Email_Spam_Detector.ipynb`.
